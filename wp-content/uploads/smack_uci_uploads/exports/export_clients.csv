274,1,2017-04-14 17:00:06,2017-04-14 17:00:06,"East Texas, affectionately referred to by locals as “the Buckle of the Bible Belt,” is home to over 1,400 churches. Every aspect of life is centered on these houses of worship.

On January 1, 2010, Little Hope Baptist Church burned to the ground. Fire officials concluded the fire was caused by an electrical problem in the century-old church’s wiring. But when nine more churches went up in flames, the rural communities of East Texas feared for the worst. With the clues beginning to point towards arson, hundreds of local law enforcement, Texas Rangers, and ATF investigators scoured the area in what unraveled to be the largest criminal investigation in East Texas history. The high profile case soon took a more personal turn when Texas Rangers followed a young man named Jason Bourque to a local store. Moments later, a janitor found scratched in the store’s bathroom the words, “Little Hope Was Arson.” Jason Bourque (19) and his best friend, Daniel McAllister (21), who were both members of a local Baptist church, were now the primary suspects.

Lead investigators Sgt. Brent Davis and Special Agent Larry Smith contacted the dispatch center to run a basic background check on the new suspects. With several hundred officers investigating the crimes that spread into three counties, the dispatch center played a pivotal role in the processing and organizing of information. Christy McAllister was the DPS Dispatcher who answered this particular call from the investigators. Her world was shattered as she heard the names of the suspects: her brother and his best friend.

Jason and Daniel first met in Sunday school as children. Children’s pastor, James Ellis, watched as these two young men went from a deep faith in God in his church classroom every Sunday, to one day seeing their mug shots on the news, arrested for the heinous crimes of burning churches. His forgiveness for them came easily; his forgiveness of himself would become an ongoing process.

Once the arrests had been made, the entire community now wrestled with practicing the forgiveness that they preached. While many were vocal in their forgiveness, others were filled with hatred toward the boys. The trial and subsequent multiple-life sentences dolled out on Jason and Daniel painted a true picture of how the community felt about these boys. Not one person was killed or seriously injured during the fires, and yet both were handed extreme sentences normally reserved for violent crimes.

Little Hope Was Arson is a feature-length documentary that tells an incredible true story of two boys with dark secrets, and the community struggling to forgive them. The film paints a fascinating portrait of the American Bible Belt set against the backdrop of a thrilling crime investigation. No stone is left unturned and even Satan himself is considered a suspect in this gripping investigation of a community terrorized from the inside out.",Little Hope Was Arson,,publish,0,closed,,little-hope-was-arson,,,2017-06-01 22:21:07,2017-06-01 22:21:07,,0,http://lovell-fairchild.dev//?post_type=clients&#038;p=274,98,clients,,0,,field_58ade3ae908d7,517,field_58dabaae72c48,,field_58dabbab72c49,http://www.littlehopewasarson.com/,field_58f1567cc0ddb,,http://lovell-fairchild.dev//wp-content/uploads/2017/04/littlehopewas.jpg,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7NzR-q_QBrydUpxTDB6bG1FeGM,field_5900d5e0fc781,

To End All Wars opened in theaters on 9/11 when terrorists attacked the US—and this important World War II movie quickly disappeared from public awareness. Now, in the year of its 10th anniversary, this magnificent film of suffering and redemption returns to theaters—starring Kiefer Sutherland, Robert Carlyle, and Sakae Kimura–directed by David Cunningham.

Based on the autobiography of Ernest Gordon (later a seminary chaplain), To End All Wars recounts the struggles and faith of four Allied POWS in a brutal Japanese labor camp. Ultimately the men, mainly from a Scottish regiment, find true freedom by forgiving their enemies.

In fact, Christians are getting the reputation of being ""against"" just about everything. But is this the best way to bear witness to the love of God before an unbelieving world? Or does it simply serve to push others further and further away from the life-giving power of Jesus?

Are you troubled by the disconnect between the words you speak and the life you live? Do you find it easier to offer words instead of actions? Would you like to see your faith become more active and life-changing in the world around you? Pastors Kerry and Chris Shook, founders of Woodlands Church outside of Houston, felt that way. Even though their calling involved preaching and teaching, they became weary of sermons and words. They felt a gap between what they were saying and meeting the needs of people around them. They decided to do something about it.

In a nutshell, they chose to talk about God less and walk with God more. Be the Message is their story of waking up to the gospel-not just a gospel of words and sermons, but the gospel of intention and action and people—and how doing so changed their family, church and personal relationship with God. It’s their story of taking one step after another to live out God’s gospel in the world. And it’s their call for us to do the same.

“Something shifts inside you when your faith is acted out,” they write. Indeed, one of the profound secrets they discovered is “You are the gospel.” The verse “the word of God lives in you” is really about life message—your life lived out, and it’s different for everyone.

For the Shooks being God’s hand and feet in the world played out in countless and different ways from converting their local church bookstore into one of the largest fair trade/direct trade stores in the country to helping a post-earthquake remote village in Haiti transform and sustain itself by learning how to produce 4x more coffee.

But their story is not intended to call everyone to a life mission overseas. Each person brings uniqueness to how he or she lives out the gospel. Be the Message provides a roadmap to the possibilities ultimately serving as an inspirational, idea-filled look at making our lives shout through actions not words.

304,1,2017-04-14 17:31:15,2017-04-14 17:31:15,"In 1982, a young, ambitious Texas entrepreneur was looking for an edge. The family business he inherited had been growing at a rate of twenty-four percent annually, but he wanted more. Not so much for the money—he had plenty—but because money was his way of keeping score. Bob Buford loved the thrill of the chase; loved growing the business. So he wrote a carefully worded letter to a man whose books he had read and ideas he treasured: Peter F. Drucker. Thus began a twenty-three year relationship that quickly progressed from paid consultant to valued mentor to close personal friend.

Drucker &amp; Me is a warm and riveting account of that unusual and unlikely relationship. Separated in age by a generation, the two seemed to have little in common. Drucker spoke with a heavy Austrian accent; Buford spoke Texan. Buford owned a cable television business; Drucker did not even own a single television. Buford followed his beloved Dallas Cowboys; Drucker followed Japanese art.

But as their relationship deepened, they discovered a mutual passion for a phenomenon they both believed could literally change the world.

Although Drucker wrote thirty-nine books, and others have written dozens more about him, this is the first book that reveals an intimate and personal side of the “father of modern management” (a moniker Drucker hated). With Drucker’s permission, the author recorded their conversations over twenty-three years which covered everything from their mentoring relationship, to Drucker’s growing disappointment with corporate America, to his enthusiastic embrace of the non-profit sector, including his eventual involvement in what he called “the most important social phenomenon in American society in the last thirty years:” the mega-church movement.

Buford, author of the best-selling book Half Time, paints an intimate portrait of a man who he considers to be to one of the most brilliant visionaries of the twentieth century. “Peter was to management what Shakespeare was to literature,” Buford observed. “His mental horizons were boundless. The examples he used came from every century and every continent.”

Drucker &amp; Me provides an inside account of how Drucker, counsel to global corporations like General Motors and proctor and Gamble, became energized by a series of under-the-radar meetings with an elite group of pastors of large churches. It takes you behind the scenes into the conversations he had with mega-church pastors and best-selling authors Bill Hybels and Rick Warren. And it traces his interest in the large evangelical church phenomenon to his belief that the goal of non-profit organizations is “changed lives.”

In addition to sharing the back story of Drucker receiving the prestigious Medal of Freedom, Drucker &amp; Me takes the reader into his humble home in Claremont, California and shows how this prolific author never let his fame or fortune change his simple approach to life: a functional house within walking distance to a job that allowed him to do what he loved; a wife he adored who repeated the same April Fool’s trick on him every year; talented children who he loved; and his writing—thirty-nine books, including the one he was working on shortly before his death at age ninety-five.

Drucker &amp; Me offers a glimpse into the heart and soul of a man whose interest in management was predicated on his passion for contributing to a “fully functioning society.” His serendipitous introduction to an entrepreneur from Texas opened a new world for both of them that resulted in the strengthening of a movement that they believed could play a significant role in restoring decency, civility, and compassion to a culture derailed by greed and dysfunction. Buford also recounts Drucker’s influence on his own personal transformation as described in his best-selling book, Half Time, and the global movement it fostered.

Where others have chronicled Drucker’s contribution to the literature and practice of management, Buford has woven a compelling and heartfelt story about the man behind the legend.Drucker &amp; Me is destined to become a classic for the millions of Drucker’s ardent fans in the business, non-profit, and a mega-church communities.",Drucker & Me,,publish,0,closed,,drucker-me,,,2017-06-01 22:21:06,2017-06-01 22:21:06,,0,http://lovell-fairchild.dev//?post_type=clients&#038;p=304,51,clients,,0,,field_58ade3ae908d7,523,field_58dabaae72c48,,field_58dabbab72c49,http://druckerandme.com/,field_58f1567cc0ddb,,http://lovell-fairchild.dev//wp-content/uploads/2017/04/buford12714.jpg,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7NzR-q_QBryUXo2Q1ZmTmZsNW8,field_5900d5e0fc781,
305,1,2017-04-14 17:32:04,2017-04-14 17:32:04,"The Fifty Shades of Grey series has done for women and erotica what the advent of the Internet did for men and porn: fuel the craze and normalize its use. With erotica sales soaring and a big-screen version of the grey phenomenon in production, clinical psychologist and best-selling author Dr. Juli Slattery partners with relationship expert and best-selling author Dannah Gresh to unveil the ugly truths of erotica in Pulling Back the Shades: Erotica, Intimacy, and the Longings of a Woman’s Heart (Moody Publishers, March 2013).

“We have met with women who started reading erotica to awaken their sex lives with their husbands, but it actually caused them to be less satisfied in their marriage bed than ever,” writes Gresh. “Single women have told us they used porn as a ‘sexual outlet until marriage’ but it suffocated their desire to pursue a relationship at all…what seemed innocent to them ended up being harmful.”

Dr. Slattery and Gresh examine erotica from a spiritual and sexual standpoint, providing Biblical teaching, personal stories and testimonies from those affected by erotica to help women navigate this uncharted territory and discover how to embrace their sexuality and spirituality. And where does “mommy porn” fall on the map?

“I believe this genre of literature and Fifty Shades of Grey specifically are very spiritual books with an aggressive spiritual agenda,” writes Dr. Slattery. “The books take you on a journey that has a spiritual impact and an intended spiritual destination: destruction.”

“We know women aren’t just drawn into books like Fifty Shades of Grey for the entertainment value,” writes Dr. Slattery. “We’ve found that women who turned to erotica are looking to satisfy one of five key longings. Too many women have been tricked into believing that an erotic book or online relationship can fulfill their deep needs. It’s time to expose that trap and reveal a way that leads to life,” writes Gresh.

Written in the authors’ two distinct voices, Pulling Back the Shades helps readers identify what they’re really longing for when drawn to erotica, why they can’t put it down, and what God says about our sexual desires. While the Bible is clear on topics such as adultery and incest, Slattery and Gresh point out where even God is “grey” on sexual matters.

Dannah Gresh is the cofounder of Pure Freedom, and a bestselling author of several books, including And the Bride Wore White, What Are You Waiting For: The One Thing No One Ever Tells You About Sex, and Lies Young Women Believe, co-authored with Nancy Leigh DeMoss, in addition to the Secret Keeper Series. She is a frequent guest for national radio, TV and print mediums. Dannah and her husband Bob live in State College, Penn.

Dr. Juli Slattery is a widely known clinical psychologist, author, speaker, and broadcast media professional. Her commitment to biblical principles, relatable style, and quick wit have made her a highly sought after speaker to women’s groups.

Firebird is a bright orange baby oriole who just loves the sunshine. But whenever a storm blows in, he frets and asks Mama why God allows the rain to take the sun away. When Firebird is finally old enough, his mother gently instructs him to fly up through the thunder and lightning to see what’s on the other side. It’s a rough flight, and just when he’s about to give up, Firebird rises above the storm to discover the sun shining where it always had been. God never lets the storm take the sun away. With that truth in his heart, Firebird continues to bask in the sunshine, but just as important, he learns to rejoice in the rain.

And the store connected them to each other. But not all stories that started at The Bridge had a happy ending. Five years earlier, Molly and Ryan were two college students united in a shared faith, love of music and an undeniable attraction to each other. But the two were separated by circumstances that cut their story short and left them with what figured to be a lifetime of questions.

When a hundred-year flood devastates the town, it nearly destroys The Bridge, crushing Charlie’s spirit and causing him to doubt whether his work in books really mattered. Then as Christmas approaches, a sudden tragedy strikes and all hope seems lost. Molly and Ryan return to Franklin, neither of them expecting to see the other and both of them needing a miracle.

It began as a book that starred in a movie. And while moviemakers expected to sell some books ... the movie, Fireproof, broke movie records, and the book — a how-to on unconditional love in marriage—so far has spent 50-plus weeks on the NYT bestseller list. That's more than 3 million copies in print. Not surprisingly, the book has expanded into a line, now debuting Love Dare Day by Day, taking love's practical applications to a full year. ""We're not into gimmicks,"" says B&amp;H Publishing, ""but we are widening the scope on these universal principles.""

It has served him well to this point, but has it prepared him to deal with the most important legal issue of our time: When does life really begin?

In preparation for the National Moot Court championship, Caleb must decide—and argue for—what he truly believes. And wherever he lands will have consequences.

If he takes the pro-life argument, he stands to lose the most important competition of his life—and the support of his mother, a high-profile lawyer. If he follows his mother's lead, he could win the coveted title ... but lose the heart of his teammate Rachel in the process.

While compromise might be the easiest solution, it could also be the most dangerous. Come What May is a vivid reminder that choosing what's right is never easy ... but it's always worth the cost.

Phil Vischer, creator of VeggieTales and now What’s in the Bible?
What’s in the Bible? is the irresistible new 13-DVD series from VeggieTales’ creator Phil Visher—focused on the bible and its themes (as opposed to bible stories), and for slightly older kids. “Small kids cut their teeth on VeggieTales bible stories,” Visher said. “I also want to give kids, getting just a little older, the fundamentals of Christianity.”

Enter Buck Denver, Man of News! British explorers Clive and Ian. The Sunday School Lady and her flannelgraph. Michael, the backseat DVD enthusiast. Country singer Chuck Wagon. In a wacky, wonderful, wild theme-park ride of a 22-minute (ish) show—predictably Visher-esque—kids learn the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, from original sin to grace and redemption, and from a lot of crazy puppets.

DVDs one, two, and three: “In the Beginning,” “Let My People Go,” and “Love and Obey.”

And the thing is, they work. Families watch. Everyone laughs. Learning happens. “Above all,” Phil says, “we remind kids often how special they are and how much God loves them.”

What’s in the Bible? is the irresistible new 13-DVD series from VeggieTales’ creator Phil Visher—focused on the bible and its themes (as opposed to bible stories), and for slightly older kids. “Small kids cut their teeth on VeggieTales bible stories,” Visher said. “I also want to give kids, getting just a little older, the fundamentals of Christianity.”

Enter Buck Denver, Man of News! British explorers Clive and Ian. The Sunday School Lady and her flannelgraph. Michael, the backseat DVD enthusiast. Country singer Chuck Wagon. In a wacky, wonderful, wild theme-park ride of a 22-minute (ish) show—predictably Visher-esque—kids learn the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, from original sin to grace and redemption, and from a lot of crazy puppets.

DVDs one, two, and three: “In the Beginning,” “Let My People Go,” and “Love and Obey.”

And the thing is, they work. Families watch. Everyone laughs. Learning happens. “Above all,” Phil says, “we remind kids often how special they are and how much God loves them.”

In other words, Soli has an incredibly bright future. But things aren’t always how they appear.

When a devastating head injury literally flips his vision—and his world—upside down, Soli is left not knowing what normal looks like anymore. His carefree ways are instantaneously replaced by fears of an unknown future.

Upside provides a unique perspective as Soli attempts to come to grips with his new reality. And that’s before he starts falling for Wren, a believer who’s been blind since birth.

Add in trouble at home with his mom, uncertainty if he will ever play lacrosse again, and a teacher that thinks he can do much more in school than he wants to, and suddenly, Soli’s senior year looks nothing like he imagined it would.

When facing life’s twists and turns, it’s important to know what you believe. And even when you can’t trust your eyes, you still have your voice.

As a crisis of faith rocks his life’s calling, former minister Jimmy Moore returns to the place he called home half-a-lifetime ago. Very little has changed in this small farming town … except for everything that he’s ever known.
He returns to find a community reeling from a recent tragic fire that took a family’s life and placed Jimmy’s best friend in a psychiatric prison.
While Jimmy’s pastoral mentor challenges him to not lose faith, his disappointed father wonders why his son always runs from challenges. Can Jimmy find the resolve—and the clues—to get to the bottom of the mysterious fire and clear his friend Travis?
Will any good come from the ashes of this tragedy? When things look their bleakest, Travis reminds Jimmy that, “God has His plan … you should know that better than anyone.”

381,1,2017-04-14 18:19:43,2017-04-14 18:19:43,"Brooks Douglass and his sister, Leslie, grew up in a home filled with love, compassion, and faith. Their father, Richard, was a leader in the Baptist Church. Their mother, Marilyn, was a woman of faith and talent, turning down a scholarship to the renowned Juilliard School to join Richard in the Brazilian mission field.

On their return, Brooks age 16 and Leslie 12, Richard became pastor of a large church in Oklahoma City. On Oct. 15, 1979, Brooks opened the door of their modest family home to what he believed was a man in need. The man, a drugged-up drifter named Glen Ake, was joined by his partner, Steven Hatch. They pulled out guns, tied up the Douglasses, repeatedly assaulted Leslie, shot all four family members, and left them for dead.

Richard and Marilyn died at the scene. Brooks and Leslie recovered from their wounds, but their ordeal had just begun.

Ake and Hatch were caught, tried, and, in 1980, sentenced to death. For the next 16 years, however, the suffering rolled on as a legal system created to protect the rights of the accused dragged the Douglass children time after time to testify in court and relive that night.
The story became national news. But it was continuing bad news for Brooks and Leslie, forced to sell their family home and possessions to pay medical bills. Brooks struggled through high school and college, repeatedly failing out, drinking heavily, and given to bouts of rage. Leslie, once a beauty queen with a beautiful voice, fought to put her life together as she dealt with recurring nightmares and struggled in relationships.

In a 1986 retrial, Ake was convicted again but received life in prison instead death. Brooks Douglass became convicted as well, convicted that the system must no longer ""step over the body of a victim to read the criminal his rights.""

Brooks earned his law degree, and, at age 27, became the youngest state senator in Oklahoma history where he passed a series of victims' rights bill.

In 1995, a second turning point came. On a legislative tour of a state prison, Brooks saw Ake–requested a chance to talk to the man who had destroyed his family. HEAVEN'S RAIN shares the dramatic result of that meeting.

After three senate terms, Brooks changed directions, pursuing long-held creative desires. With Hollywood writer and director Paul Brown, Brooks co-wrote the HEAVEN'S RAIN script and produced and starred in the film.

While never shying from the hard facts, HEAVEN'S RAIN ultimately is a tribute to the love and faith of Brooks' parents. The Sunday before the tragedy, in fact, Richard Douglass preached on forgiveness. In a dramatization of that moment in the film, Brooks himself, playing his father, quotes the book of Matthew: ""He sends the rain on the just and the unjust,"" and William Shakespeare: ""The qualify of mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven.""",Heaven's Rain,,publish,0,closed,,heavens-rain,,,2017-06-22 20:11:27,2017-06-22 20:11:27,,0,http://lovell-fairchild.dev//?post_type=clients&#038;p=381,75,clients,,0,,field_58ade3ae908d7,,field_58dabaae72c48,,field_58dabbab72c49,http://heavensrainmovie.com/index.php,field_58f1567cc0ddb,,field_5900d5e0fc781,,field_59372df65dbf8,

Fueled by revenge, Michael (Philip Bulcock) sets up a meeting at an out-of-the-way diner with the man who murdered his wife and child six years earlier. But his plans of killing him come to a sudden standstill when two gunmen burst in to rob the place. Michael takes matters into his own hands, shooting a robber and holding the entire diner hostage until the man he really wants to target arrives. In the midst of all these events, Michael finds an unlikely ally in Don (Kim Estes), a devout Christian who believes God is going to help him in his endeavor.

The Ani-Mates—a bear and a puppy, with a lamb coming for the Easter season—feature mouths that move in simulated speaking as digitally recorded Bible stories play through hidden speakers. Plus, with a free app, children can see the stories on a smart phone.

Now, young women enter college passionate about succeeding in a lifetime career, often adding a graduate degree. They envision a future that includes marriage and a family. Many remain single longer than past generations, and want to be financially equipped to take care of themselves no matter what relationships bring. And many are deeply committed to their faith.

But women don’t easily find the practical mentoring and support that men naturally extend to each other. Young women need Godly role models who have walked in their shoes with integrity and success – as they enter the post-college world dreaming of prosperous careers and forging healthy relationships with lasting potential.

CampKivu.com
Andy Braner is an expert on the challenges today’s Christian teens face and on giving young people tools to face them. Andy sees many kids go to college where their faith dies on the vine. Camp Kivu – in the beautiful Colorado Rockies – equips kids to go back into high school or prepares them to go to college strong and assured of their faith and how to do life with it. With Camp Kivu, seven- or 14-day stints of exciting Colorado adventure equips them with answers to the Big Questions. Kivu also offers an innovative “Gap Year” program, taking high school graduates literally around the world, placing them in service, enterprise, and leadership positions. Kivu is a new kind of camp for the new challenges Christian kids face today. In addition to founding and running Camp Kivu, Andy is the author of Love This and Duplicate This, unique books for the unique challenges today’s teens face.

Story Angles:
- Christian camps in a post-9/11 world. What has changed? What shouldn’t?
- The Gap Year – Investing time between high school and college to prepare for life in the real world by literally going around the world – working, serving, growing.
- Not your parents’ teen years – For teens today, Christian and non-Christian, everything has changed. How do they cope? How do parents help?
- Sex and the Single Teen – It’s worse than you think with greater opportunity than you know

He's built an international movement known as Somebody Cares, spurring grassroots response to community crises including devastation from natural disasters, poverty, homelessness and more.

To the point of his work these days, Doug Stringer grew up without a father. The author of the new ""Hope for a Fatherless Generation"" and the classic ""Who's Your Daddy Now?"" is a rising voice, ringing the alarm about the overwhelming epidemic, the individual and cultural consequences of a society overflowing with fatherless boys and girls, men and women. But Doug's message is not all grim. He encourages Christian men to step up as spiritual fathers to the fatherless.

SYNOPSIS
Don Piper died Jan. 18, 1989, when a semi-tractor truck crushed his car. Declared dead by the first rescue workers to arrive on the scene, Don’s body lay under a tarp for the next 90 minutes. His soul, meanwhile, experienced love, joy and life as he’d never known before. Don was in Heaven.

When another pastor’s prayers helped bring Don back to life, he became a living miracle. Yet this is one miracle Don wished never happened. Heaven’s bliss was replaced by excruciating pain and emotional turmoil. With the support and prayers of his beloved Eva, their three kids and friends near and far, Don clung to his faith in God and fought to regain a semblance of his previous life. The Piper family’s incredible true story of perseverance and overcoming the challenges of life—and death—brings hope and encouragement to all who see it.
Starring Hayden Christensen and Kate Bosworth, 90 MINUTES IN HEAVEN is based on the inspiring New York Times bestseller with 7 million books sold. In theaters everywhere September 11, hope lives.

NEWS HOOKS

An International Bestseller Comes Home to Houston
Near I45 in Huntsville 26 years ago, in hard rain, a semi-tractor trailer hit Don Piper’s car and killed him. Ninety minutes later he was alive again but facing 15 months at Hermann Hospital. What happened in those 90 minutes led to a runaway bestseller and, now, a national movie featuring Hayden Christensen and Kate Bosworth. On Sept. 11, the real people from the story will gather for its world premiere.

What about ‘Heaven Tourism’ Stories?
The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven recently came out as fabricated and publishers rushed to pull it. What about other accounts? 90 MINUTES IN HEAVEN details Don Piper’s immediate death from a head-on collision, his 90-minute visit to heaven and his return to a life of faith-shaking pain and physical rehab. And for years he kept the story to himself. “Piper struck me as a reliable witness,” Christianity Today editor Mark Galli wrote. “Piper simply had the look and sound of sanity, of someone who was telling the truth, whose word was his bond.” Talk to filmmakers about their focus on the true telling of an amazing story.

Giving Films Gives Away the Profits
When has a film company formed to send all profits to charities that help women and children? 90 MINUTES Producer Rick Jackson founded Giving Films to be a “giving engine,” and persuaded Don Piper to trust him to tell his story accurately.

SYNOPSIS
Don Piper died Jan. 18, 1989, when a semi-tractor truck crushed his car. Declared dead by the first rescue workers to arrive on the scene, Don’s body lay under a tarp for the next 90 minutes. His soul, meanwhile, experienced love, joy and life as he’d never known before. Don was in Heaven.

When another pastor’s prayers helped bring Don back to life, he became a living miracle. Yet this is one miracle Don wished never happened. Heaven’s bliss was replaced by excruciating pain and emotional turmoil. With the support and prayers of his beloved Eva, their three kids and friends near and far, Don clung to his faith in God and fought to regain a semblance of his previous life. The Piper family’s incredible true story of perseverance and overcoming the challenges of life—and death—brings hope and encouragement to all who see it.

Starring Hayden Christensen and Kate Bosworth, 90 MINUTES IN HEAVEN is based on the inspiring New York Times bestseller with 7 million books sold. In theaters everywhere this fall, hope lives.

NEWS HOOKS
What about ‘Heaven Tourism’ Stories?
The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven recently came out as fabricated and publishers rushed to pull it. So what about other accounts? 90 MINUTES IN HEAVEN details Don Piper’s immediate death from a head-on collision, his 90-minute visit to heaven and his return to a life of faith-shaking pain and physical rehab. And for years he kept the story to himself. “Piper struck me as a reliable witness,” Christianity Today editor Mark Galli wrote. “Piper simply had the look and sound of sanity, of someone who was telling the truth, whose word was his bond.” Talk to filmmakers about their focus on the true telling of an amazing story.

438,1,2017-04-14 22:42:42,2017-04-14 22:42:42,"SAN ANTONIO – Jan. 4, 2013 – Dr. James Dobson’s BUILDING A FAMILY LEGACY conference comes to San Antonio—the place where it all began 35 years before—Saturday, Jan. 19, at Cornerstone Church. The one-day event—which is free with reserved tickets (www.buildingafamilylegacy.com)—offers parents vital insight into biblical principles for raising godly families and affecting generations to come.

“I’m looking forward to being back in San Antonio where God blessed this message years ago,” Dr. Dobson said. “Now, with the experience of raising children behind me, and the glory of grandchildren before me, I have a broadened perspective and new insights I’m eager to share with today’s parents and grandparents.”

BUILDING A FAMILY LEGACY has deep San Antonio roots. In 1978, Dr. Dobson presented a seminar at Laurie Auditorium that he titled Focus on the Family, and video cameras ran. That series was eventually seen by 80 million people around the world and launched his national ministry. Now, BUILDING A FAMILY LEGACY offers fresh insight on timeless principles encouraging parents and grandparents to make a lasting difference. Session topics from Dr. Dobson include Legacy, Bringing Up Boys and Bringing Up Girls.

The BUILDING A FAMILY LEGACY event begins with an optional complimentary continental breakfast at 7:30 a.m., with doors for the conference opening at 8 a.m. The event, which concludes at 1:30 p.m., also includes complimentary lunch, and child care is provided (reservations needed).",Building A Family Legacy With Dr. James Dobson - San Antonio,,publish,0,closed,,building-a-family-legacy-with-dr-james-dobson-san-antonio,,,2017-06-01 22:21:06,2017-06-01 22:21:06,,0,http://lovell-fairchild.dev//?post_type=clients&#038;p=438,31,clients,,0,,field_58ade3ae908d7,,field_58dabaae72c48,,field_58dabbab72c49,https://direct.cornerstone.cc/FamilyTalk+Shop/item/building_a_family_legacy_8_dvd_set__dvd_,field_58f1567cc0ddb,

Our desire is that our audience will gain clear understanding and inspiration through these presentations, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and deepen their relationship with our Father through Him.

446,1,2017-04-14 22:51:14,2017-04-14 22:51:14,"Canton Junction isn’t your typical quartet. As the name suggests, it is a place where four diverse talents intersect—one an internationally known pastor, one a former bricklayer, one a Grand Ole Opry performer, and one who discovered his calling at a Cathedrals concert—united by their love for music, family, and the desire to proclaim in song what God has done in their lives. With individual resumes including Grammy Award nominations, multiple GMA Dove Awards and Singing News Fan Awards, and citing musical influences from southern gospel to country to Big Band, Canton Junction effortlessly blends traditional and contemporary sounds for a cutting-edge style all its own.

The group’s origins can be traced back to San Antonio’s Cornerstone Church in 2011, when founding members Matthew Hagee, Michael Sykes and Aaron Crabb hastily prepared to sing “At the Cross” during a service, after a last-minute cancellation. The harmony was so effortless, they knew this was no accident. Shortly thereafter, bass singer Tim Duncan joined and a group name was chosen: Canton Junction, which means “when good things come together.”

Since their official debut in 2012, the Texas-based quartet has thrilled audiences across the U.S., Canada, Scotland and Israel with their inspiring message and high-energy performances. The quartet’s debut album, Canton Junction (Difference Media), garnered a GMA Dove Award for Southern Gospel Album of the Year and two chart-topping singles, “Hold On” and “Sweeter as the Days Go By.” The momentum continued with the group being named Favorite Southern Gospel New Traditional Quartet at the 2014 Singing News Fan Awards. Canton Junction has also used its platform to raise awareness and funds for the Dream Center in Los Angeles, to which the members donated proceeds from their recording of the soul-stirring “Back On My Feet Again.”

The group’s talent and passion shine through on their highly anticipated Every Hallelujah, the first recording to feature new members Ryan Seaton (baritone) and Casey Rivers (lead), joining Hagee and Duncan. Well-known to gospel music audiences, Seaton toured with Ernie Haase &amp; Signature Sound from 2003 to 2009, during which time the group received multiple Dove Awards and a Grammy nomination. Pursuing a successful solo career, Seaton’s 2010 album, The Stage Is Bare was recognized with two Dove nominations. A highly acclaimed vocalist in multiple genres, Rivers was a finalist on USA Network’s Nashville Star in 2006 and, as a country solo artist, shared stages with the likes of Loretta Lynn and Kenny Rogers. From 2008 – 2012 Casey served as lead vocalist for southern gospel trio Beyond the Ashes.

Produced by award-winning musician Garry Jones, and featuring powerful new songs alongside well-loved classics, Every Hallelujah is a perfect reflection of both the talent and heart of Canton Junction. The wide array of songs selected for Every Hallelujah showcases the remarkable versatility of this combination of voices, a quality which still takes Hagee by surprise every time they sing together. “Ryan’s traditional quartet stylings and Casey’s contemporary country sound have allowed us to take a fresh approach to who we are as Canton Junction.”

“When people listen to Every Hallelujah, they’re going to be taken on an emotional roller coaster,” enthuses Seaton. “I really think people will relate to these songs.” Rivers adds, “I’d say this collection of songs, including more originals than in the past, puts even more of a stamp on who Canton Junction is.”

The dramatic debut single, “Weep No More,” penned by Ben Storie and Lee Black, features Rivers’ powerful vocals declaring the Lord’s return, with tight harmonies and haunting chord progressions overlaying the stirring track. The song is also featured in the film Four Blood Moons, which set box office records and is based on Pastor John Hagee’s bestselling book.

Seaton’s soulful baritone shines on “A Place Called Grace,” written by Sue C. Smith and Kenna West. “The line I really love hits home because I think we’ve all been there,” he muses. “You came to me when the sun was shining bright/It’s just so easy to ignore You when all’s well in my life. So many times when things are going well, we think we need Him less. So every time I sing that song, it brings back the truth that no matter where you’re at in your life, you always need Him.”

Kenna West teamed with Jason Cox to write the gentle, country-tinged ballad “For Moments Like These,” which urges believers to trust the Father during circumstances that may be painful or hard to understand: Faith was made for moments like these/ When God knows what you can’t see. Matthew Hagee shares why this song has gripped his heart: “It doesn’t matter who you are or what you are going through, if you don’t understand what God’s doing and you simply say, ‘God, I don’t understand it, but I’m going to choose to believe You anyway,’ then you get the affirmation you need.”

Tim Duncan enjoys the up-tempo “I Need a Little More Jesus,” as well as “God’s Got a Better Plan,” written by legendary southern gospel writer Ronny Hinson. “You may think you have it all planned out, but God’s got a better plan. He sees the big picture,” Duncan explains.

As evidenced through the songs of Every Hallelujah, the hope of each of the members of Canton Junction is to allow God’s Love to permeate not only their own hearts, but to touch everyone who listens to the music. “People can expect to have their hearts lifted,” says Seaton of the group’s live performances, “and I think they’ll leave better off than they came in.” Hagee concludes, “We’re going to do everything we can to give audiences the opportunity to escape whatever is bothering them at that moment and to remind them that God’s still on His throne and everything’s going to be alright. It may be by clapping their hands to a good beat, or it may be in lifting hands in an atmosphere of praise, or it may be just in a simple, quiet moment when a familiar ballad serves as a reminder that God has a great plan for our lives. Our main purpose and goal is to express His love through the music we like to sing.”",Canton Junction Band,,publish,0,closed,,canyon-junction-band,,,2017-06-01 22:21:06,2017-06-01 22:21:06,,0,http://lovell-fairchild.dev//?post_type=clients&#038;p=446,35,clients,,0,,field_58ade3ae908d7,577,field_58dabaae72c48,,field_58dabbab72c49,https://www.facebook.com/CantonJunctionMusic,field_58f1567cc0ddb,,http://lovell-fairchild.dev//wp-content/uploads/2017/04/canton-junction.jpg,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7NzR-q_QBryQncyZFVNQXpUOFE,field_5900d5e0fc781,

performance a year later. In early violin training his studies with artists and
professors at universities and colleges across Canada included scholarships to
the Young Artist Performance Academy at the Royal Conservatory of Music in
Toronto where he studied primarily with Joan Barrett. Completing his scholarship
with Oleh Krysa at the renowned Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y.,
Christer moved to Germany under the mentorship of Rudolf Gaehler, studying
violin both there and in Italy. He has also studied with Martin Beaver, Pinchas
Zukerman, David Cerone, Sally Thomas, Dr. Lise Elson and Jose Luis Garcia.

Besides taking honors at music competitions, Christer appeared many times on
CBC radio, on television and in recordings. Since 1994, he’s led programs in
more than 2,000 concert halls, churches, embassies, schools, universities and
conferences—across Canada, the U.S., Europe and Asia.

As a world-class violinist, Christer stays in demand as a solo artist at leading
concert halls worldwide. His commitment to telling stories with music, and his
belief, however, also take him to churches, faith conferences and Christian
events. In his highly original style, Christer plays as film behind him turns music

That message turned out to be marriage—God’s view of it, God’s way of it. And the movie would be FIREPROOF, the story of a fireman whose marriage is in flames. One day, asked to read The Love Dare “for just 40 days,” he begins an unexpected journey to live out unconditional love for his estranged wife. As his own heart opens to God’s love, new love for his wife rekindles their relationship. FIREPROOF earned more than $38 million at the box office and became 2008’s No. 1 independent film.

Of course, early movie audiences wanted to know: “Where is the real Love Dare?” And the Kendricks were back in prayer. As the film’s success gave hope to marriages in trouble, The Love Dare offered the real deal: practical relation-building tools.

462,1,2017-04-17 16:33:19,2017-04-17 16:33:19,"NASHVILLE—Jan. 19, 2010—Cartoonists across America will draw more than comic relief for the next three weeks as they post their work on eBay in an unprecedented online fundraiser. Spearheaded by former Disney artists Tom Bancroft, director Tony Bancroft (“Mulan”) and Chad Frye, auction funds will help support the family and finances of fellow cartoonist Tim Hodge.  Hodge’s son Matthew remains in a coma five months after his car collided with a train.

At 1 p.m. ET on Thursday, Jan. 21, the NCSF 501(c)(3) launches the eBay fundraiser to benefit the Hodge family.  Some 165 treasures from 115 artists feature:
•    An original Charles Schulz “Charlie Brown” drawing
•    An illustration by famous movie poster artist Drew Struzan
•    Character drawings by Disney supervising animators of characters from the new “The Princess and the Frog” feature film
•    Illustrations of “Po” from “Kung Fu Panda” character designer Nico Marlet.
•    A drawing by the 2010 Golden Globe winning director of Pixar’s “Up” Pete Docter signed by actor Ed Asner.

“Art’s coming from all over the country and beyond,” organizer Tom Bancroft said, amazed. “Almost every major animation film studio is represented.”

How does the auction work?  “For three weeks—on Jan. 21 and 28, and Feb. 4—starting at 1 p.m. ET , we’ll post about 55 new items throughout the day, the lots appearing in seven-minute intervals,” Tony Bancroft explained.  “Each ‘lot’ or set of items will stay up for 10 days (with some overlap) and will clearly post the NCFS logo. And each item has its own URL.”

“The NCSF is accepting donations on behalf of the Hodge family,” Chad Frye said. “It is just amazing to see the outpouring of support from the cartooning community, many of which have never even met the Hodges.” High bidders as well as those making cash donations receive a tax write-off.

While many of the artists do not know Tim Hodge personally, the kinship of one of their own going through this difficult time resonates with every one of them.  Jean Schulz, widow of ""Peanuts"" creator Charles Schulz, said, ""Please know my heart goes out to Matthew and his family and I wish them well on their road to recovery.""

On August 22, 2009, Matthew, the 17-year-old son of former Disney story artist and Big Idea Productions Director Tim Hodge, was driving across railroad tracks in his hometown of Franklin TN when his car was struck by a train going 50 mph.  Though Matt suffered neither broken bones nor internal organ damage, severe head trauma caused a coma. Today Matt—a high school senior, straight-A student, and a drummer in his state championship marching band—remains comatose.

As with many self-employed artists, Matt’s father has short-term medical insurance that falls short of long-term injury care.  Compounding the Hodges’ financial crisis and mounting medical bills, Matt’s need for constant care affects Tim’s ability to work full time.

The NCSF (<a href=""http://www.lovell-fairchild.com/www.CartoonistFoundation.org"">www.CartoonistFoundation.org</a>) is the charitable arm of the National Cartoonists Society, the world's largest and most prestigious organization of professional cartoonists. It was formed in 2005 to continue the charitable and educational works that have been a hallmark of the NCS since its inception in 1946. The NCSF exists not only to help fund educational endeavors for cartooning but to help cartoonists in times of great hardship, like the Hodges.

75 Years After Dancing Past Barriers and into History,
Norma Miller Screens New QUEEN OF SWING Documentary

From The Today Show on NBC: Vimeo.com/14064319

For tickets: ApolloTheater.org

NEW YORK CITY—Aug. 12, 2010—Seventy-five years after winning her first Lindy-Hop dance contest at the famed and legendary Apollo Theater, eccentric, trailblazing, 90-years young Norma Miller returns to the Apollo main stage in grand style. Sunday Aug. 29 at 4 p.m. and 8 p.m., Norma introduces two premiere screenings of QUEEN OF SWING—a documentary from Emmy-Award winning director John Biffar, narrated by co-producer and veteran actor Bill Cobbs.

Fifteen years in the making, QUEEN OF SWING is the unique and gripping tale of a black woman’s adventure. Armed only with her own talent, music and dance, she broke down visible and invisible walls of discrimination and paved the way for groundbreaking integration around the world.

Dancer, actress, author, standup comedian, and Emmy award-winning choreographer are but a few titles on Norma’s resume. QUEEN OF SWING takes the audience on a historical personal escapade from the 1930’s black exodus to Europe, to witnessing the election of America’s first black President.

Along the way we meet household legends of jazz: Bassie, Armstrong, Ellington, and others. Their music provided the pulse that fueled Norma and the rest of her Lindy Hoppers as they tore up dance floors around the world. According to Norma, the secret to her longevity and success can be summed up in a quote from her own mother: “When you ain’t got a horse . . . you ride a cow.” A simple philosophy but one that provided her a way to successfully navigate the restrictive corridors of segregation and replace it with an infectious spirit of love for all people.

Miss Miller’s autobiography Swing, Baby, Swing chronicles the evolution of Swing in the 21st Century. Swingin’ at the Savoy—A Memoir of a Jazz Dancer recollects her youthful years with Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Billy Holiday, Benny Goodman, Ethel Waters and many other jazz legends. Her film credits include the Marx Brothers’ DAY AT THE RACES (1938), HELLZAPOPPIN’(1941), choreographer for MALCOLM X (1992), and CAPTIVA ISLAND (1994).

QUEEN OF SWING was produced by Dreamtime Entertainment and written and directed by Emmy award-winner John E. Biffar. Biffar first met Miller after directing her on his 1994 feature film CAPTIVA ISLAND. QUEEN OF SWING is narrated and co-produced by veteran actor Bill Cobbs. The film was edited and co-produced by Emmy award-winner Dave Beaty. QUEEN OF SWING executive producer is Paul Bush.

Gray Media and Ribbow Media, inassociation with Lovell-Fairchild Communications, present the second-ever Faith in Film panel. (Last year’s panelwas standing-room only.) Reception to follow.

“Cecil B. Demille’s ‘The Ten Commandments’ and Spencer Tracy in ‘Boys Town’ belong to another time now,” TimGray, founder and president of Gray Media said. “In 2016, faith in a film is a differentiator, a flash point, and thetension turns up the conversation. We’re asking what works, what hasn’t, and why.”

Gray’s Faith in Film conversation this year unites Ash Greyson whose Ribbow Media specializes in marketing filmsdigitally, including many top faith-based hits; Daniel Lusko, director of the faith-based thriller 'Persecuted'; and NancyLovell partner at Lovell-Fairchild, a publicity firm, 13 of whose recent faith-related movies have opened in the U.S. top10 box office. A fourth panelist is to be named.

“Ribbow recognized key new trends years ago and acted on them,” Greyson said. “We’re eager to talk about whatwe’re seeing now.” In the past 18 months, Ribbow’s work has covered 50 films, many aimed at niche markets--fromthe faith blockbuster “God’s Not Dead” ($60 million box office), to the indie “Dear White People,” ($31,000 PTA in 11theaters on opening weekend).

489,1,2017-04-17 19:27:24,2017-04-17 19:27:24,"ROD DEBIAS AND THE GRIZZLY

Where the Bearing Sea meets the Alaskan shore, even in May the hard-packed ice runs feet deep, spreading against the shoreline 50 to 150 yards wide depending on how the surges wash up and freeze through the long winter. The surges spill up driftwood, too, from huge logs to sticks and random pieces that floated for years until catching a hundred yards up on land. From the icepack at the edge, the surface filters inland into open tundra that looks like pastureland until a person walks on it and tufts of vegetation tug like giant sponges at every step. A man’s foot sinks two to four inches, drawing the energy out of every step.

Past midnight, along the horizon, the sun had washed the tundra in an unearthly glow. From where I stood talking with Don, my guide, the view led to mountainous country—as close as three miles in some places, other places, six to ten miles. We were still talking when the bear appeared. Somewhere between the first rise and the mountains, a shadow ascended from a low spot, not skylining itself, but against the mountains in those bright first hours after the Alaskan midnight.

Don and I stood like two people on a street corner, discussing our moves for the next day, thinking we would try, come daylight, to rejoin the other hunters. The grass is forever greener. We figured they were seeing all the bears while we saw nothing. I had told Don I thought we should move, and I’d asked him how he felt about it.

He felt the same, he said. And no sooner did he say so than I saw the shape amass over his shoulder about 385 yards from us—hardly a shape at first but quickly materializing into a bruin.

“Don! Bear!” I whispered. We dropped down inside a driftwood pile, sticks and logs waist high. I knelt as low as I could and Don knelt behind me. I set my bow in the bear’s direction so that should the time come, I’d only draw and fire. Several minutes later the range was 175.

We stayed put, kneeling on soft, dry grass in ample cover, Don’s elbow pressed against my shoulder as he checked wind with a squeeze bottle of white power. With his right hand, he continued to range; I could just make out his mumbles. “Hey, Rod, it’s the big guy!”

The bear paused with its head down. “Look at that noggin,” Don whispered again, annoying me now to hear him raise the stakes.

“You just keep ranging,” I whispered. “I’ll let him walk past before I draw and he sees me.” Don locked the rangefinder onto a piece of driftwood above the others directly in line with the giant’s path. “Seventeen yards.”

The bear passed the protruding stick and continued closer to us. Fifteen yards. Thirteen yards. He stopped and lifted his massive head, nostrils flaring. He inhaled slowly, three deep breaths, curling his lips to taste the air. He knew something was out of place. Each time he breathed, the air filled with the stench of dead beavers.

Thankfully, the wind held. He hadn’t seen us and I had just reminded myself that this was all business when he rose and towered and I could feel him glaring at our camouflaged silhouettes. I wanted to order Don to shoot but his rifle was in a grass bank ten yards away. The massive head rotated away from us. “It’s over,” I thought. “He doesn’t know we’re here. He’s as good as dead.”

He dropped to all fours. His senses forced one final hesitation and he began to lumber further past. I waited to move unseen. When I lost sight of his eye, I slowly drew, centering my peep sight on the sight ring, the pin just past his right shoulder. I felt the wind in my face. Good. He was well in range and I admired his size. A lifetime of waiting rushed at me. I could have loosed an arrow at any point.

The giant angled away then, standing perfectly broadside. “Twenty-nine yards.” With pins adjusted to 30 yards, I squeezed the release. The Lumenok traced through the dusky pre-dawn air, disappearing behind the front shoulder.

The bear snarled and bit at the entry wound. He wheeled, searching for the source of the pain. Wheeling back and mortally wounded, he staggered away. I nocked another arrow and quickly adjusted my pin to 60 yards but never drew. Sixty yards from me, the bear piled up, nose first.
---

When did it start, people ask me, this near-compulsion to hunt grizzly? I was a kid, I tell them, eight or nine, when I held my first Bear Grizzly Recurve, the bow my dad used when he was a kid. He let me have it when we were moving to another house and I found it in his closet. By the time I was 11, I was shooting it seriously—so seriously that when the limb split after a couple of years, I mowed a lawn for a full summer in exchange for my client’s old Fiberglass Ben Pearson bow. To this day, I still have both. After that came a Bear Whitetail bow for $99. The summer I was 15, to pay for it, my best friend, Lou Mihalko, and I painted his grandmother’s house for $100 each.

Since the first time I’d strung a bow with the word grizzly on it, since my uncles watched my shooting practice from the porch and told me that bow was only for hunting grizzly, my single goal was to take one, though a boy never imagines the time, the miles, the arrows, the trips, the hunts, the sightings, the nights, the stories, the shots, and the years that come and go without a dream realized. In a large sense—and this is important—it didn’t matter. I love hunting the way I love breathing: naturally, without analysis—and I’ve been fortunate to take some nice animals in my life, including a brown bear several years ago. Decades had passed since the day I found my father’s Recurve and begged to own it, but the grizzly had eluded me almost to the point of my conceding.

Grizzly was far from my mind, therefore, when, after months of kicking around hunts and ideas—Sheep . . .Moose . . .Elk--a friend suggested a grizzly hunt. Shortly after, I settled on an outfitter: Hunt Alaska. They don’t just accept bow hunters for grizzly, they want ‘em.

Forty years after I shot my first arrow, I finally harvested a grizzly. Not just any grizzly, but the new world record.
